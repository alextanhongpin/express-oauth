# OAuth-Server with Express.js

A simple implementation of oauth server with express.js

NOTE: This module is not production-ready. It is just a pet project meant that I carry out for the following reasons:

1. Understand how to architecture a scalable and maintainable app independent of the language (There are several similar implementation in different language, e.g. [koajs](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/koa-openid-server)).
2. Understand the best practices for models, services, error handling etc.
3. Understand how to split the services (microservices) and avoid coupling between different services.
4. Understand how to carry out testing using the Specification by Examples.
5. Understand how to log errors correctly according to the (Twelve Factor Apps)[https://12factor.net/].
6. Understand how to apply the practices from (Twelve Factor Apps)[https://12factor.net/] to make the app better.
7. Understand the need to add/reduce complexity and the reasoning behind it. 
8. Understand the design patterns that are necessary, or anti-patterns to avoid.


This project is not completed by all means. I'm currently working on a Koa.js version which you can find [here](https://github.com/alextanhongpin/koa-openid-server), just to see how Koa.js compares to Express.js.
